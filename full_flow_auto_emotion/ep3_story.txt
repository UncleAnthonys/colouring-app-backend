Title: Meeting the Glimmer-Sprites

Story: Following the wind's soft guidance, Sparkle found a hidden nook where a family of tiny, shimmering Glimmer-Sprites lived, their bodies faintly sparkling even without much color. They were delighted to see Sparkle's radiant fur and told her that the Color Collector lived atop the Shimmering Peaks, guarded by tricky illusions. Sparkle felt a surge of excitement, knowing she was on the right path to restoring joy.
