Title: A World Without Color

Story: One sunny morning, Sparkle stumbled upon a village that had lost all its beautiful colors, appearing utterly dull and uninviting. The villagers moved slowly, their smiles faded, and even the flowers seemed to droop without their natural hues. Sparkle felt a pang of sadness in her heart, realizing how much joy colors brought to the world.
