Convert the uploaded photo into a children's colouring book page.

FACIAL LIKENESS (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
- Faces MUST be recognisable as the actual people in the photo
- Keep each person's real face shape, eye shape, nose, mouth
- Keep exact hairstyles - long hair stays long, short stays short
- A parent must recognise their children immediately
- Simplify for colouring but KEEP THE LIKENESS - not generic cartoon faces
- The people from the photo MUST be the MAIN focus and largest figures in the scene
- Do NOT add other human characters at the same size - any additional people must be much smaller background/supporting roles only

STYLE TARGET: Classic children's colouring book - simple, clean, easy to colour.

COMPOSITION RULES (CRITICAL):
- SIMPLE BACKGROUND ONLY: Plain sky with 2-3 simple clouds, simple flat ground
- NO busy backgrounds - no detailed trees, no forests, no complex scenery
- NO scattered small objects - no rocks, pebbles, grass blades, leaves on ground
- Maximum 8-12 main elements in the entire image
- Lots of WHITE SPACE between elements
- Every element well-spaced and clearly separated

LINE QUALITY (CRITICAL):
- ALL lines must connect perfectly - no gaps
- Thick, bold, smooth outlines
- Every shape fully enclosed for colouring
- No sketchy or broken lines
- No fine details or thin lines

SIMPLIFICATION:
- Clothing: Simple shapes, no complex patterns
- Objects: Bold simple outlines only
- Background: Minimal - sky, ground, maybe 2-3 simple elements

BANNED (DO NOT INCLUDE):
- Generic cartoon faces - faces must look like the real people
- Detailed foliage or trees with many leaves
- Ground texture of any kind
- Scattered debris, rocks, grass
- Complex patterns
- Tiny details

FRAME:
- All elements fully within frame
- Clear margins on all sides
- Centred composition

OUTPUT: Black lines on pure white background. No grey. No texture. No shading.
