Scene: Rainbow Princess stands in a grand, empty hall, looking at a giant, blank mural canvas on the wall. Her hands glow faintly with nascent colors, and a mischievous smile plays on her lips.

Story: The Grand Festival of Art was approaching, but the Royal Mural Hall felt strangely quiet with its enormous blank canvas. Rainbow Princess felt a spark of curiosity, wondering what amazing artwork could fill such a space.
