Title: The Missing Bridge

Scene: Rainbow Princess stands at the edge of a wide, sparkling river, looking across to a small island where a group of laughing children are stranded, unable to cross. Her hands are outstretched, beginning to stream glowing red and orange colors.

Story: On her way to gather inspiration, Rainbow Princess discovered that the Rainbow River's playful bridge had vanished, leaving some children stuck on a tiny island. With a determined breath, she focused her powers, knowing she could weave strong, shimmering colors into a new, temporary bridge. She knew her vibrant red could be the perfect strong base, followed by a bright orange path for everyone to cross safely.
