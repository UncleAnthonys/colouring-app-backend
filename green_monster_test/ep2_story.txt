Title: Blending into the Meadow

Scene: Green Monster is flattened slightly, practically a part of the tall, swaying green grass in a vibrant meadow, observing a group of colorful hummingbirds fluttering around strange, wilting flowers. The sun shines brightly.

Story: The next clue led Green Monster to the Sunbeam Meadow, where beautiful flowers were strangely losing their petals. By flattening its wide, green body against the ground, Green Monster became almost invisible amidst the tall grass. It watched patiently, determined to see what was bothering the delicate blossoms and the hummingbirds.
