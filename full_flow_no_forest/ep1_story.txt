Title: A Whisper of Gray

Scene: Rainbow Princess stands on a balcony of her shimmering cloud castle, looking out at a sky that usually bursts with color but now shows faint patches of gray. A tiny, worried cloud sprite floats beside her.

Story: Rainbow Princess noticed a strange paleness spreading across the horizon, where yesterday the clouds shimmered with vibrant pinks and blues. She knew something wasn't right in her beautiful Cloud Kingdom, feeling a flutter of worry in her chest. The normally bright rainbow bridge that led to the next floating island looked a little dull, almost sleepy.
