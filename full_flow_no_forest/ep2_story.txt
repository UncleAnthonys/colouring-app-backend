Title: The Fading Rainbow Bridge

Scene: Rainbow Princess carefully steps onto the rainbow bridge, its colors visibly dimming beneath her feet. She holds a small, glowing prism that seems to react to the fading light. A small, fluffy cloud pet (like a lamb) follows nervously.

Story: Eager to investigate, Rainbow Princess decided to cross the famous Rainbow Bridge, a pathway usually alive with dazzling light. As she walked, the radiant colors beneath her felt less bouncy, and she wondered why the magic seemed to be fading away. Her tiny cloud-lamb companion, Nimbus, whimpered softly, sensing the change too.
