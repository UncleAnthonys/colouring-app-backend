Title: The Fading Garden

Scene: Rainbow Princess, looking worried, stands in her normally vibrant royal garden. Roses are turning grey, and a bluebird looks dull. She gently touches a faded leaf.

Story: One morning, Rainbow Princess noticed something strange: her magnificent royal garden was losing its brilliant colors. The once-scarlet roses had become a dull grey, and even the bluebirds seemed to have lost their shimmering feathers. She knew she had to discover what was happening to her beautiful, colorful kingdom.
