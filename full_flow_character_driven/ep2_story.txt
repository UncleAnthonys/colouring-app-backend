Title: A Bridge of Shimmering Hues

Scene: Rainbow Princess joyfully extends her arms, conjuring a spectacular, arching rainbow bridge made of glowing colors. Two small, puffy cloud-critters look amazed as they prepare to cross a wide gap to another cloud island.

Story: A tiny group of Cloud-Critters was stranded across a giant sky gap, unable to reach their berry bushes on another island. Rainbow Princess, with a flick of her wrist, created a magnificent, shimmering rainbow bridge. Her colorful creation allowed the grateful creatures to cross safely, proving rainbows were more than just beautiful sights.
