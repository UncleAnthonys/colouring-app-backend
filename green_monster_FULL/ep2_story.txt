Title: The Sleepy Seedlings

Scene: Green Monster kneels beside a patch of droopy, colorless seedlings in a garden, its gentle green glow bathing them. A small gnome gardener looks on, hopeful.

Story: The garden's new seedlings were too shy to sprout, looking very sleepy and gray. Green Monster carefully sat nearby, letting its calming glow encourage the little plants to feel safe and grow.
