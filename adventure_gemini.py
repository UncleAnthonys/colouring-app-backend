- Look at the previous page image carefully
- Identify the KEY OBJECTS in that scene (climbing frame, oven, fountain, tree, building, vehicle, etc.)
- If the current scene is in the SAME LOCATION, those key objects MUST STILL BE VISIBLE
- A climbing frame doesn't disappear between pages. An oven doesn't vanish. A fountain stays there.
- The story is happening IN a location — draw that location consistently

📐 BUT CHANGE THE COMPOSITION:
- Different camera angle (close-up vs wide shot vs overhead)
- Character in a different pose and position on the page
- Different objects in the FOREGROUND (but background setting stays consistent)
- Different arrangement of supporting characters

🎨 VISUAL CONTINUITY CHECKLIST:
- Same location = same key landmarks visible (even if from a different angle)
- SUPPORTING CHARACTERS MUST MATCH: Look at the previous page image. Any supporting character that appears again MUST look identical — same species, same size, same shape, same accessories. Read the scene description for character names and match them to the characters visible in the previous page.
- Same weather/time of day
- Only change the setting when the STORY says they moved to a new place

Think of it like a movie — the camera angle changes between shots but the SET stays the same.

- BLACK lines (#000000) 
- WHITE background and fill areas (#FFFFFF)
- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE

CHARACTER: {character_name}
Use the reference image for SHAPE AND FORM ONLY - completely ignore all colors:
- Body shape, proportions, and size
- Distinctive features (number of eyes, horns, fur texture, etc.)
- Clothing style and accessories (but NOT their colors)

🚨 CRITICAL - THIS CHARACTER IS BASED ON A REAL PHOTO (toy/pet/person):
- Draw the character EXACTLY as they appear in the reference - DO NOT add new clothing or accessories
- If the character is an ANIMAL (dog, cat, etc): Draw them AS AN ANIMAL - no human clothes, no dresses, no shirts
  - Keep their natural markings, spots, patches visible as line art areas to color
  - They can stand on hind legs (anthropomorphized pose) but their BODY stays animal
  - Fur patterns and markings become distinct outlined areas for coloring
- If the character is a TOY/PLUSH: Keep their ORIGINAL outfit from the reference
  - Do NOT change or replace their clothing - it is part of who they are
  - A ballerina toy stays in their ballet dress, a superhero toy keeps their cape
- If the character is a PERSON: Keep their actual clothing from the reference
- The reference shows EXACTLY what this character looks like - match it precisely

*** SECOND CHARACTER: {second_character_name} ***
A second reference image is attached for {second_character_name} ({sc_desc}).
Use this second reference image for {second_character_name}'s SHAPE AND FORM ONLY — ignore all colors.

RULES FOR TWO CHARACTERS:
- BOTH {character_name} AND {second_character_name} MUST appear in the scene
- Use the FIRST reference image for {character_name}'s appearance
- Use the SECOND reference image for {second_character_name}'s appearance
- Each character must be clearly recognizable from their respective reference
- Both characters should be prominent in the scene — not one tiny in the background
- If {second_character_name} is an animal: Draw them AS AN ANIMAL — no human clothes, keep their natural markings as line art areas to color, floppy ears stay floppy, spots stay spots
- If {second_character_name} is a person: Keep their clothing and features from the reference
- Both characters should be INTERACTING in the scene (looking at each other, working together, reacting to events)

'''
        
        full_prompt += f'''🚨 CRITICAL - DO NOT ADD OR REMOVE BODY PARTS:
- Count the arms in the reference - draw EXACTLY that many arms (usually 2)
- Count the legs in the reference - draw EXACTLY that many legs (usually 2)
- DO NOT add extra arms, tails, horns, wings, or appendages that aren't in the reference
- DO NOT add stripes or patterns to the body that aren't in the reference
- The character has a SPECIFIC anatomy - copy it EXACTLY

⚠️ CHARACTER BODY RULES:
- Keep STRUCTURAL LINES from reference (dress segments, buttons, hair sections)
- These define colorable areas - KEEP THEM
- But DO NOT ADD decorative patterns, swirls, or stripes to the character's body
- NO spirals, NO mandala patterns, NO decorative flourishes ON the character
- Character's body sections should be PLAIN WHITE inside, ready to color
- BACKGROUND can have intricate details, but CHARACTER stays structurally simple

STORY SCENE:
{scene_prompt}

*** STORY TEXT FOR THIS PAGE ***
{story_text if story_text else "No story text provided."}

*** CRITICAL — THE COLORING PAGE MUST SHOW THE KEY MOMENT FROM THE STORY ***
- READ the story text above carefully. Identify the SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ACTION or moment.
- Draw THAT exact moment — not the moment before it, not the setup, THE KEY ACTION ITSELF.
- Example: If the story says "Sid blocked the cake with his belly" → draw Sid WITH the cake pressed against his belly, NOT the cake rolling past him.
- Example: If the story says "she caught the ball" → draw her HOLDING the ball, NOT the ball in mid-air approaching her.
- The image must show the ACTION COMPLETED or IN PROGRESS, never just about to happen.
- Every object mentioned in the scene description should be VISIBLE in the image.
- Do NOT draw a generic "character standing in a location" — draw the SPECIFIC ACTION described.

╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: 100% MONOCHROME - BLACK INK ON WHITE PAPER            ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

**THE REFERENCE IMAGE HAS COLORS - YOU MUST IGNORE THEM COMPLETELY**
The reference shows a colorful character. DO NOT reproduce those colors.
Convert everything to BLACK OUTLINES on WHITE:
- Pink dress section → WHITE area with BLACK outline
- Blue dress section → WHITE area with BLACK outline  
- Green dress section → WHITE area with BLACK outline
- Yellow hair → WHITE area with BLACK outline strokes
- Blue nose → WHITE area with BLACK outline (NOT blue!)
- ALL colors → WHITE areas with BLACK outlines

⚠️ ABSOLUTELY NO COLOR OR GREY ANYWHERE:
- No blue tints on nose, legs, or any body part
- No grey shading in trees, sky, or background
- No gradient fills anywhere
- Every single area must be PURE WHITE (#FFFFFF) inside
- The ONLY non-white pixels are the BLACK lines (#000000)

🎯 CRITICAL - PRESERVE CHARACTER'S EXACT SHAPE:
*** CRITICAL - EXACT CHARACTER COPY ***
- COUNT the arms in reference image - draw EXACTLY that many (usually 2)
- COUNT the legs in reference image - draw EXACTLY that many (usually 2)
- Copy the character's EXACT body shape from the reference (rectangular, round, blob, etc.)
- If reference shows a RECTANGULAR/SQUARE body → draw RECTANGULAR/SQUARE body
- If reference shows a ROUND body → draw ROUND body  
- If reference shows a PLAIN/SIMPLE body → keep it PLAIN/SIMPLE
- DO NOT add extra limbs, tails, wings, or features not in the reference
- The character must look IDENTICAL to the reference - same simplicity level
- Match the reference EXACTLY - no additions, no modifications
- Only convert COLORS to white - keep all SHAPES identical

**MONOCHROME MEANS:**
- Only 2 values: BLACK (#000000) and WHITE (#FFFFFF)
- No RGB colors at all - not even pale/light versions
- No pink, no blue, no green, no yellow, no red, no orange
- No grey, no cream, no beige, no any tint
- Like a photocopied line drawing

**EVERY AREA IS WHITE:**
- Character's dress = WHITE (all sections)
- Character's hair = WHITE  
- Character's skin = WHITE
- All clothing = WHITE
- All background = WHITE
- Children will add colors with their crayons

**INCLUDE MANY COLORABLE OBJECTS:**
- Add objects and details that fit the story scene
- Each object should be a clear, enclosed shape for coloring
- Fill the scene with things to color

*** OUTPUT SPECIFICATION ***
Format: Pure black line art on white background
Colors allowed: BLACK and WHITE only
Shading: NONE
Gradients: NONE
Tints: NONE

This is a COLORING BOOK PAGE - children color it themselves.

FINAL CHECK - CRITICAL RULES:
1. Every pixel must be pure black (#000000) OR pure white (#FFFFFF) - nothing else
2. NO colors from reference - no blue, no orange, no any color
3. NO SOLID BLACK FILLS - clothing, hair, skin must be WHITE with black OUTLINES only
4. Black is ONLY for outlines/lines, NEVER for filling areas
5. All enclosed areas must be empty white space for children to color in'''

AGE GROUP: 2-3 YEARS OLD (TODDLER)

*** WRITING STYLE ***
- Rhyming and rhythmic text is ESSENTIAL - every episode should have a rhyme or repeated phrase
- Sound effects on every page: "SPLISH!", "BANG!", "WHOOOOSH!", "POP POP POP!"
- Very short sentences (5-8 words max)
- Repetition with variation is the #1 tool - same phrase structure, different word each time
- Fun made-up words: "splishy-sploshy", "rumbly-tumbly", "snore-a-saurus"
- Basic emotions only: happy, sad, scared, excited, surprised
- Direct address to the reader: "Uh oh!", "Oh no!", "Can YOU see it?"

*** BEFORE YOU WRITE ANYTHING - DEFINE THE STORY DRIVER ***
Every great toddler story has ONE clear answer to: "What does the character WANT?"
The want must be something a 2-3 year old understands and cares about:
- Wanting to make a friend but being too scary/loud/big
- Wanting to help but accidentally making things worse
- Wanting to join in but not knowing how
- Wanting to give someone a present/surprise but everything goes wrong on the way
- Wanting to get home but obstacles keep appearing
- Being hungry and trying to find food

The character's special feature must be WHY they struggle (it causes the problem)
AND eventually WHY they succeed (they learn to use it differently).

*** WHAT SEPARATES A BAD STORY FROM A GOOD ONE ***

A BAD toddler story has:
- No clear WANT (character just wanders around)
- Feature causes RANDOM chaos with no purpose (loud = stuff breaks, strong = stuff smashes)
- Resolution is just "do the opposite" (loud -> quiet, fast -> slow)
- No emotional moment — nothing to make the kid feel anything
- No reason for the kid to care what happens next

A GOOD toddler story has:
- A SPECIFIC want the kid can relate to (help a friend, get somewhere, give a present, fix a mistake)
- Feature causes SPECIFIC funny problems that block the want (not random destruction)
- Each failed attempt is different and funnier than the last
- An emotional low point where the character feels sad/stuck (this is what makes the win feel good)
- A CREATIVE resolution where the feature is used in a SURPRISING new way (not the obvious use, not just "stop using it")
- The resolution connects emotionally to the want — not just "problem fixed" but "friendship strengthened" or "character accepted"

CRITICAL: DO NOT use the same story as the examples above. Pick from the SCENARIO POOL below and apply these principles to create something ORIGINAL.
The scenario pool has 180 creative starting points — USE THEM.

*** STORY STRUCTURE - USE ONE OF THESE 3 PROVEN PATTERNS ***

PATTERN A: "REPETITION WITH SURPRISE" (like Dear Zoo, Brown Bear Brown Bear)
- Episodes 1-3: Same pattern repeats with a different funny thing each time
- Episode 4: The pattern changes or breaks in a surprising way
- Episode 5: Satisfying conclusion that calls back to episode 1
Example: Character tries to find something. Ep1: finds wrong thing (too big!). Ep2: finds wrong thing (too small!). Ep3: finds wrong thing (too noisy!). Ep4: surprise - the thing finds THEM! Ep5: happy together.

PATTERN B: "ACCUMULATING CHAOS" (like The Very Hungry Caterpillar)
- Each episode adds ONE more silly thing to a growing pile of chaos
- By episode 3-4, everything is hilariously out of control
- Episode 5: one big action fixes everything (or makes it even funnier)
Example: Character accidentally makes one mess. Then a bigger mess. Then an ENORMOUS mess. Tries to clean up but makes it worse. Finally one silly accident fixes everything at once.

PATTERN C: "JOURNEY WITH OBSTACLES" (like We're Going on a Bear Hunt)
- Character goes somewhere, hits an obstacle, gets past it with a fun sound/action
- Each obstacle is different and fun to act out
- Final obstacle leads to a big surprise
- Then rush back home!
Example: Ep1: Can't get past the puddle (SPLASH!). Ep2: Can't get past the hill (WHEEE!). Ep3: Can't get past the sleeping dragon (SHHHHH tip-toe!). Ep4: Made it! But wait - surprise twist! Ep5: Rush home, funny ending.

*** WHAT MAKES TODDLER STORIES WORK ***
- A parent reading aloud should naturally do funny voices and actions
- At least ONE moment where the kid will LAUGH (physical comedy, something going splat, a funny noise)
- The character DOES things - never just looks or observes
- Predictable pattern that kids can "join in" with after one hearing
- A warm "everything's OK" ending
- The ending must MAKE SENSE: if the character made a mess, the mess leads to the solution. If they broke something, the broken thing becomes useful. The "mistake" should secretly BE the answer.

*** BANNED FOR AGE 3 ***
- Passive searching (look here, look there, found it, done)
- Character just observing or noticing things
- Abstract or conceptual themes
- Stories with no funny moment or surprise
- RANDOM SCENE JUMPS: every episode must connect to the previous one. If the character was in a park, explain HOW they got to the next place. A toddler story is simple but it still makes SENSE.

*** SCENE DESCRIPTIONS FOR AGE 3 ***
- Character should be LARGE in frame (40%+ of image)
- Maximum 2-3 background objects per scene
- Big chunky shapes, but still clearly narrative (viewer can tell what's happening in the story)
- Supporting characters big and simple with clear expressions
- Each scene looks VERY different from the last

*** TEXT LENGTH — STRICTLY ENFORCED ***
- 1-2 very short sentences per episode
- MAXIMUM 20 WORDS per episode. Count them. If it's over 20, cut it down.
- At least one sound effect or exclamation per episode
- Final episode: shortest of all (under 15 words)
- If you find yourself writing more than 2 sentences, you are writing TOO MUCH for a toddler
- Think: "Hop hop hop! Oh no — SPLAT! Sam fell in the mud." = PERFECT length
""",

        "age_4": """
AGE GROUP: 4 YEARS OLD

*** WRITING STYLE ***
- Rhyming is great but not required on every line
- Lots of sound effects: "KERPLUNK!", "tip-toe-tip-toe", "KABOOM!"
- Simple sentences (8-12 words) with occasional longer ones for drama
- A catchphrase or repeated question works great as a story thread
- Funny comparisons: "as tall as a house!", "louder than a thunderstorm!"
- Questions to the reader: "What do YOU think happened next?"
- Named emotions: scared, brave, proud, grumpy, excited, worried, silly

*** BEFORE YOU WRITE - DEFINE THE STORY DRIVER ***
Every story needs ONE clear answer to: "What does the character WANT, and what's stopping them?"
The want should be specific and urgent — not vague:
- BAD want: "Jerry wants to be helpful" (vague, no urgency)
- GOOD want: "Jerry wants to win the talent show but his big mouth keeps scaring the judges"
- BAD want: "Ted wants to explore" (no stakes, no obstacle)  
- GOOD want: "Ted needs to get the class hamster back in its cage before the teacher returns, but his big feet keep knocking things over"

The character's special feature must create a SPECIFIC, FUNNY obstacle to getting what they want.
The resolution must be CLEVER — not just "stop doing the bad thing" or "do the opposite."

*** STORY STRUCTURE - USE ONE OF THESE PATTERNS ***

PATTERN A: "THE CLEVER TRICK" (like The Gruffalo)
- Character faces a problem bigger than them
- Uses their special feature in a CLEVER way (not the obvious way)
- Moment of "oh no, it didn't work!"
- They try a smarter version and it works
- Everyone is impressed (or the trick is hilariously revealed)
Key: Character should be SMART, not just lucky.

PATTERN B: "THE GROWING TEAM" (like Room on the Broom)
- Character sets off on a mission alone
- Episodes 2-3: Meets helpers with funny personalities
- Episode 4: Individual efforts fail - they must work TOGETHER
- Episode 5: Team victory + celebration
Key: Each helper adds something funny AND useful.

PATTERN C: "THE BIG MISTAKE" (like Elmer, Oi Frog)
- Character does something causing an unexpected chain reaction
- Things get progressively sillier and more out of control
- The "mistake" turns out to be something good or useful
- Or the character learns they were great all along
Key: Comedy from things going wrong in UNEXPECTED ways.

*** WHAT MAKES AGE 4 STORIES GREAT ***
- A moment where the kid gasps or says "oh no!"
- A genuinely funny bit that makes the parent laugh too
- Supporting characters with ONE clear personality trait (the grumpy one, the scared one, the bossy one)
- The main character solving the problem THEMSELVES (no adult swooping in to fix it)
- Physical comedy AND verbal comedy together
- The solution must LOGICALLY follow from the problem — not a random new action

*** SCENE DESCRIPTIONS FOR AGE 4 ***
- Character prominent but not dominating (30-40% of image)
- 3-5 background objects per scene
- Moderate detail, some fun things to discover (a funny sign, a hidden creature)
- Supporting characters with clear distinctive looks
- Mix close-ups and wider shots across the 5 episodes

*** TEXT LENGTH ***
- 2-3 sentences per episode (25-40 words)
- Dialogue in at least 3 episodes
- Sound effects in at least 2 episodes
- Final episode: 2 short punchy sentences
""",

        "age_5": """
AGE GROUP: 5 YEARS OLD

*** WRITING STYLE ***
- Natural storytelling voice with personality
- Fun words: "super-duper", "teeny-tiny", "ginormous", "splashy-splashy", "rumbly-tumbly"
- Sound effects for impact: "CRASH!", "SPLORT!", "WHOMP!"
- Sentences 8-15 words, with occasional longer ones for dramatic moments
- Dialogue is essential - characters TALK to each other with personality
- Exclamations: "No way!", "That's impossible!", "Not AGAIN!"
- Character thoughts: "Tommy scratched his head. This was going to be tricky..."

*** BEFORE YOU WRITE - DEFINE THE STORY DRIVER ***
Answer these before writing a single word:
1. What does the character WANT? (Must be specific: "save the baby penguin" not "help others")
2. WHY do they want it? (Emotional reason: "because the penguin is crying and alone")
3. How does their special feature make it HARDER? (The feature causes a specific funny problem)
4. How does the feature eventually HELP in an UNEXPECTED way? (Not the obvious use)

BAD: Feature just does its obvious thing and saves the day.
GOOD: Feature causes problems all story, then the character finds a creative sideways use.

The OBVIOUS use of a feature is always BORING. The SURPRISING use is what makes great stories:
- BAD resolution: Feature does exactly what you'd expect (big mouth = shouts to save the day, many arms = grabs things)
- GOOD resolution: Feature is used SIDEWAYS — in a way nobody expected (big mouth becomes a boat, many arms become a bridge, big eyes become mirrors)
The weirder and more creative the use, the better the story. Pick from the SCENARIO POOL and find an unexpected angle.

*** STORY STRUCTURE ***

STRUCTURE A: "RESCUE/DELIVERY UNDER PRESSURE" (like Zog, Supertato)
- Episode 1: Clear urgent problem - someone needs help or something must be delivered NOW
- Episode 2: First attempt using the character's special feature
- Episode 3: SETBACK - the attempt fails or makes things worse. Moment of doubt.
- Episode 4: Creative solution - uses their feature DIFFERENTLY, or gets unexpected help
- Episode 5: Victory! Resolution connects back to episode 1 in a satisfying way
Key: The setback must feel real. The kid should worry it won't work out.

STRUCTURE B: "MYSTERY/DETECTIVE"
- Episode 1: Something weird is happening - clues are found
- Episode 2: Follow clues, meet a witness/helper with a funny personality
- Episode 3: Red herring! They blame the wrong person/thing (funny misunderstanding)
- Episode 4: Real answer discovered - surprising and funny
- Episode 5: Everything explained, problem solved, the "culprit" had a good/sweet reason
Key: The mystery answer should be funny or heartwarming, not scary.

STRUCTURE C: "ACCIDENTAL HERO" (like Dogger, Giraffes Can't Dance)
- Episode 1: Character feels they can't do something or doesn't fit in
- Episode 2: Forced into a situation where they HAVE to try
- Episode 3: Their attempt goes hilariously wrong
- Episode 4: But the "wrong" thing accidentally solves a bigger problem nobody noticed
- Episode 5: Character celebrated for being exactly who they are
Key: Message through ACTION not moralising. Show don't tell.

*** WHAT MAKES AGE 5 STORIES GREAT ***
- A setback that makes the kid say "uh oh, NOW what?!"
- Dialogue that sounds like real characters talking (not narration dressed as speech)
- At least one genuinely funny moment
- Supporting characters who actively HELP or HINDER - not just stand around watching
- An ending that makes the kid want to hear the story AGAIN
- The character's feature used in a way that surprises even the character
- The solution must come FROM the problem — the "disaster" secretly created the answer

*** SCENE DESCRIPTIONS FOR AGE 5 ***
- Rich detailed scenes with lots to colour
- 4-6 background objects plus supporting characters
- Mix compositions: wide establishing shots, close-up action, overhead views
- Characters showing clear emotions through body language
- Fun details that reward looking closely
- Each scene genuinely different in setting and feel

- 2-3 sentences per episode (30-50 words)
- Dialogue in at least 3 of 5 episodes
- At least one sound effect or onomatopoeia
- Final episode: short and punchy, don't summarise
""",

        "age_6": """
AGE GROUP: 6 YEARS OLD

*** WRITING STYLE ***
- Confident narrative voice with humour and personality
- Funny comparisons: "as bouncy as a kangaroo on a trampoline!"
- Dramatic pauses built into text: "And then... silence."
- Character voice should be distinct - the way THEY would say it
- Include thoughts AND dialogue: '"This is fine," thought Mo. It was NOT fine.'
- Longer sentences OK for tension (up to 20 words)
- Break the fourth wall occasionally: "Now, you might think this was a good idea. It was not."

*** BEFORE YOU WRITE - DEFINE THE STORY DRIVER ***
1. What does the character WANT? (Specific, urgent goal)
2. What are the STAKES? (What happens if they fail? Someone gets hurt/disappointed/left out)
3. How does the feature create an interesting DILEMMA? (It helps in one way but hurts in another)
4. What does the character LEARN? (Not a preachy lesson — an earned realisation through action)

The resolution must be CLEVER and EARNED — not just "try harder" or "believe in yourself."
The character should solve the problem in a way that reframes the whole story.

*** STORY STRUCTURE ***
Age 6 can handle real plot twists and emotional stakes:

- Episode 1: Establish the character's world AND the problem in the same beat. Hook immediately.
- Episode 2: First plan - starts well but a complication appears
- Episode 3: MAJOR SETBACK - plan fails badly. Character's limitation exposed. Lowest point.
- Episode 4: Realisation or unexpected help. New approach using what they LEARNED from failing.
- Episode 5: Climax and resolution - clever solution, ending connects to opening, final joke or emotional beat.

*** KEY PRINCIPLES ***
- The setback must be REAL - not just "oops, wrong place." Something genuinely goes wrong.
- Supporting characters have their own mini-motivations (not just cheerleaders)
- Dramatic irony where possible (reader knows something the character doesn't)
- The ending is EARNED - character MAKES things work out, things don't just happen to work
- Humour from character and situation, not just random wackiness

*** SCENE DESCRIPTIONS FOR AGE 6 ***
- Detailed rich scenes appropriate for the age
- 5-7 background objects/elements
- Dynamic compositions: action mid-movement, dramatic angles
- Environmental storytelling (background details that hint at the story)
- Varied settings that feel like a real world

*** TEXT LENGTH ***
- 3-4 sentences per episode (40-60 words)
- Mix of dialogue, action, and internal thought
- Final episode: wrap up efficiently, don't drag
""",

        "age_7": """
AGE GROUP: 7-8 YEARS OLD

*** WRITING STYLE ***
- Witty, fast-paced narrative with a strong authorial voice
- Humour through irony, exaggeration, and understatement
- Characters have distinct speech patterns and personalities
- Can include mild peril and genuine tension
- Internal monologue: "This was either the bravest or the stupidest thing Mo had ever done. Probably both."
- Wordplay and clever descriptions
- Sophisticated emotions: embarrassment, determination, reluctant admiration

*** BEFORE YOU WRITE - DEFINE THE STORY DRIVER ***
1. What does the character WANT? (Compelling, specific goal with real urgency)
2. What are the STAKES? (Real consequences — not just "things go wrong" but someone is counting on them)
3. What is the COST of the character's feature? (Every power has a downside that creates tension)
4. What is the TWIST? (Something the reader thinks they understand that gets reframed)

The best stories at this age have a moment where the reader's assumption is flipped.

*** STORY STRUCTURE ***
Full 5-act structure with genuine stakes:

- Episode 1: Hook immediately. Problem established with urgency and real consequences.
- Episode 2: Investigation/preparation. Build the world. Introduce allies and obstacles with personality.
- Episode 3: MAJOR FAILURE. Plan backfires spectacularly. Real consequences. Supporting characters affected too.
- Episode 4: Character adapts. Uses their feature in an unexpected creative way. Combines what they learned from failure.
- Episode 5: Climactic resolution with a twist. Ending reframes something from episode 1. Satisfying but not predictable.

*** KEY PRINCIPLES ***
- Real stakes: feelings get hurt, something important is at risk, time runs out
- Multiple characters with competing goals (not just good vs evil)
- The obstacle/villain should have an understandable motivation
- Humour and tension ALTERNATE - don't be one or the other, be both
- The character's special feature should have a COST or LIMITATION
- Subvert expectations at least once

*** SCENE DESCRIPTIONS ***
- Complex detailed scenes with many colourable areas
- Rich backgrounds with environmental storytelling
- Dynamic action compositions with movement
- Multiple characters interacting with clear body language
- Intricate details that reward careful colouring

*** TEXT LENGTH ***
- 3-4 sentences per episode (50-70 words)
- Heavy on dialogue and character interaction
- Can include mini-cliffhangers between episodes

        prompt = f'''You are creating personalized story adventures for a childrens coloring book app.

Based on this character named "{character_name}", generate 3 UNIQUE story themes that are PERSONALIZED to this specific character's features.

CHARACTER TO ANALYZE:
{character_description}

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY THE MOST UNUSUAL FEATURES (in order of priority):
Look at the character description. Find the WEIRDEST, most UNUSUAL things:

PRIORITY 1 - UNUSUAL BODY PARTS (these are the MOST interesting for stories!):
- Multiple eyes? (10 eyes = can see in all directions, never surprised, finds lost things)
- Multiple arms? (8 arms = ultimate helper, best hugger, amazing juggler, one-monster band)
- Multiple legs? (4+ legs = super fast, never falls over, great dancer)
- Wings, tails, horns, antennae? (each one = special ability!)

PRIORITY 2 - UNUSUAL NUMBERS:
- More than 2 of anything = VERY interesting for stories
- 10 eyes means 10 different things they can watch at once
- 8 arms means they can do 8 things at once

PRIORITY 3 - Colors and patterns (LEAST interesting - only use if nothing else):
- Only use color if there's nothing more unusual about the character

DO NOT make stories about:
- "camouflage" or "blending in" (boring!)
- "colors fading" or "restoring colors" (overdone!)
- Body shape unless it's truly unusual

STEP 2 - PICK AND ADAPT A SCENARIO

Below is a pool of 180 story scenarios. For each of your 3 themes:
1. Pick a scenario that the character's unique feature would be PERFECT for
2. ADAPT it — don't copy it word-for-word. Change details, combine ideas, make it your own
3. The character's feature should be essential to the story but in a SURPRISING way

The scenario is the STARTING POINT. The character's feature determines HOW they deal with it.
Example: "A duplicating machine made 50 copies of the headteacher" + a character with many eyes = each eye can track a different copy, but they keep getting confused when copies swap clothes. Eventually they spot the real one because only the original has a coffee stain on their tie.

Each theme MUST use a DIFFERENT unique feature as the main plot device.

*** CRITICAL: EVERY THEME MUST HAVE A CLEAR "WANT" ***
Before writing each theme, define:
- WANT: What does the character specifically want? (NOT vague like "help others" or "explore" — SPECIFIC like "rescue the stuck kitten" or "find their lost friend" or "win the sandcastle competition")
- OBSTACLE: How does their special feature make this HARDER? (The feature should cause funny, specific problems)
- TWIST: How does the feature eventually help in an UNEXPECTED way? (Not the obvious use)

Stories without a clear WANT are boring. "Character walks around and their feature causes random chaos" is NOT a story.
"Character desperately wants X but their feature keeps causing Y" IS a story.
NEVER include specific body part numbers in theme names.

*** SCENARIO POOL ***

{shuffled_scenarios}

*** HOW TO USE THESE SCENARIOS ***

1. Read the character's features from STEP 1
2. Scan ALL 180 scenarios — DO NOT just pick from the top of the list! Read the ENTIRE list before choosing.
3. Pick the 3 where the character's feature would create the FUNNIEST, most SURPRISING story
4. Each theme must use a DIFFERENT feature
5. NEVER pick scenarios 1-20 unless they are genuinely the best fit — the top of the list is NOT better than the rest
6. ADAPT the scenario — change names, settings, details, put your own spin on it. The scenario is a starting point not a script
7. The character's feature should help in a SURPRISING way, not the obvious way
8. NEVER use the scenario's exact wording in the theme blurb — rewrite it completely

{age_guide}

CRITICAL: Follow the age guidelines above exactly for sentence length, vocabulary, and complexity.

*** FORMAT ***

For each theme provide:
1. Theme name (fun, age-appropriate)
2. Theme description (1 sentence)
3. Theme blurb (ONE short punchy sentence, MAX 15 words. Describe the chaos/situation only. NEVER mention the character's body parts in the blurb)
4. 5 episodes with: episode number (1-5), title, scene_description, story_text, emotion

Scene descriptions MUST focus on THE MAIN ACTION of the episode:
- ALWAYS START with the LOCATION: "In the kitchen...", "At the park climbing frame...", "Still at the fountain..."
- What is the character DOING? (not just standing — show the action mid-happening)
- What are the VISIBLE CONSEQUENCES? (ketchup on the floor, cake flying through air, toys scattered everywhere)
- What is the character's BODY LANGUAGE? (slumped and sad, jumping with excitement, running away in panic)
- Include specific setting details and 3-4 background objects to colour
- IMPORTANT: If the scene is in the SAME LOCATION as the previous episode, REPEAT the key setting objects (climbing frame, oven, fountain etc.) — don't assume the artist remembers them
- SUPPORTING CHARACTERS: Every time a supporting character appears in a scene description, include their species, size, and any accessories in brackets. Example: "Pip (small duck with bow tie)" or "Mrs. Whiskers (tall cat wearing apron)" NOT just "Pip". NO COLOURS — this is a colouring book. Describe by shape and features only. Use the EXACT SAME description each time so they look consistent across pages.
- Mix close-ups, wide shots, and action scenes across the 5 episodes
- The scene description is what gets drawn — if you don't describe it, it won't be in the image!

Story text: Follow the age guidelines for length. Final episode should be short and punchy.

Supporting characters: When you introduce a supporting character, define their appearance with a brief tag describing species, size, and accessories (NO COLOURS). E.g. "Pip (small duck with bow tie)". Then in EVERY scene_description where that character appears, include the SAME tag after their name. The artist has no memory between pages — if you just write "Pip" they will draw a different character each time.

Emotion must be one of: nervous, excited, scared, determined, happy, curious, sad, proud, worried, surprised, embarrassed, panicked

*** EMOTION RULES — CRITICAL ***
- You MUST use at LEAST 3 DIFFERENT emotions across the 5 episodes
- Episodes 1-3 should ESCALATE emotionally (e.g. curious → worried → sad)
- Episode 3 (the setback) MUST NOT be "happy" or "excited" — use sad, worried, scared, or panicked
- Episode 5 (resolution) should be happy, proud, or excited
- NEVER use "happy" for more than 2 episodes
- The emotion should match what the character FEELS in that moment of the story

*** 6 NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES ***

1. CHARACTERS: At least 2 named supporting characters with funny personalities who appear throughout, not just once.
2. SETBACK ON EPISODE 3: Character tries and FAILS or makes things worse. Makes the win feel earned.
3. DIALOGUE: At least 3 of 5 episodes need characters talking in speech marks.
4. ENDING: Episode 5 resolves the specific problem from episode 1. No generic happy endings.
5. NEVER copy a scenario word-for-word. Adapt it, remix it, make it feel fresh and unique to this character.
6. NUANCED RESOLUTION: The character's feature should NOT directly fix the problem alone. Instead, a SUPPORTING CHARACTER should suggest a new way to use the feature, OR the character should learn to use it differently after the setback. The solution should feel like a team effort or a moment of growth, not just "feature solves everything".

CHARACTER: {character_name}
CHARACTER DESCRIPTION: {character_description}

CHOSEN THEME: {theme_name}
THEME DESCRIPTION: {theme_description}
THEME BLURB: {theme_blurb}

STORY PLAN:
- Feature used: {feature_used}
- WANT: {want}
- OBSTACLE: {obstacle}
- TWIST: {twist}

{age_guide}

*** STORY STRUCTURE ***
- Episode 1: Set up the problem. Introduce 2 named supporting characters with funny personalities (include species, size, accessories in brackets after each name).
- Episode 2: First attempt using the character's feature. Things start going wrong.
- Episode 3: SETBACK — attempt fails or makes things worse. Real moment of doubt. This episode MUST NOT be happy.
- Episode 4: Creative solution — uses feature DIFFERENTLY based on the twist. A supporting character helps or suggests the new approach.
- Episode 5: Resolution that connects back to episode 1. Short and punchy ending. Do NOT summarise or moralise.

*** SCENE DESCRIPTIONS ***
- Start each with LOCATION: "In the kitchen...", "At the park..."
- Show the ACTION mid-happening, not characters standing around
- Include VISIBLE CONSEQUENCES (things scattered, flying, broken)
- Include character's BODY LANGUAGE
- 3-4 background objects to colour
- SUPPORTING CHARACTERS: Every time they appear, include species/size/accessories in brackets. Example: "Pip (small duck with bow tie)". NO COLOURS. Use SAME description each time.
- IMPORTANT: The brackets with character descriptions are for scene_description ONLY. In story_text, just use the character's NAME — never include the bracketed description tags in story_text. Example: scene_description says "Pip (small duck with bow tie) runs over" but story_text says "Pip ran over".
- Mix: wide shots, close-ups, action scenes across 5 episodes
- If same location as previous episode, REPEAT key setting objects

NARRATIVE FLOW: Each scene must feel like a CONTINUATION of the previous page. If episode 2 ended running toward the park, episode 3 should START at the park.

*** EMOTION RULES ***
- Use at LEAST 3 DIFFERENT emotions across 5 episodes
- Episodes 1-3 should ESCALATE (e.g. curious → worried → scared)
- Episode 3 MUST NOT be happy or excited
- Episode 5 should be happy, proud, or excited
- Emotions: nervous, excited, scared, determined, happy, curious, sad, proud, worried, surprised, embarrassed, panicked

*** NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES ***
1. At least 2 named supporting characters throughout
2. SETBACK on episode 3
3. Dialogue in at least 3 of 5 episodes
4. Episode 5 resolves the specific problem from episode 1
5. The feature should NOT directly fix the problem alone — a supporting character helps or the character learns to use it differently
